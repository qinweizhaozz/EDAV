### First attempt

[EDAV7_2_transitions.html](EDAV7_2_transitions.html)

**Of note:** 

* Rather than smoothly transitioning off to the left, all bars are resized when "Remove bar (left)" is clicked

* When "Remove bar (right) is clicked, the bar on the right immediately disappears, and then the remaining bars transition to their new places to the right.

### Join data by key to maintain object constancy

**Of note:** 

* Bars now smoothly transition off to the left and right
